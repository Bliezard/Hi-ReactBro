# IMPORTANT CSS PROPERTY - 
1. Flexbox Basics
display: flex;: This property turns the container (the parent element) into a flex container. Its immediate children (flex items) will be laid out according to the Flexbox model.
2. flex-wrap: wrap;: This property allows flex items to wrap onto multiple lines if they cannot fit in a single line. The default value is nowrap, which means all flex items will be forced onto one line, no matter how much space is available.

# How to Use
To use these properties, you'll do the following:

1. Set the parent element to display: flex;.
2. Use flex-wrap: wrap; on that same parent element to allow the child elements to wrap onto new lines if necessary.

# When to Use
1. Responsive Design: Flexbox is ideal for responsive web design since it can adjust the layout on-the-fly based on the available space. When the viewport size changes, flex items can wrap and reorder.
2. Alignment of Items: It allows easy alignment and distribution of space among items in a container.
3. When Items Are Dynamic: If the number of items is dynamic (e.g., based on user input), a flex container can accommodate this complexity gracefully.
